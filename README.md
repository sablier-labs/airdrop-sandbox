## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Web3**: viem, wagmi, RainbowKit
- **Merkle Trees**: OpenZeppelin SDK
- **Package Manager**: bun

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following CLI tools installed:

- **[bun](https://bun.sh)** - Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for project tasks

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
   - WalletConnect Project ID
   - Merkle root hash
   - Airdrop contract address
   - Chain ID
   - IPFS URL for Merkle tree JSON

3. **Run development server:**

   ```bash
   just dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   just build
   ```

## Commands

See [justfile](./justfile) for all available commands:

- `just dev` - Start development server
- `just build` - Production build
- `just full-check` - Lint, format check, type check
- `just full-write` - Auto-fix all issues

## Customization

This sandbox is designed for easy customization. Look for `/* CUSTOMIZATION POINT */` comments throughout the codebase.

Key areas to customize:

- Campaign metadata (name, description, dates)
- Brand colors and logo
- Success/error messages
- Contract addresses and network configuration

See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) for detailed instructions.

## Merkle Tree Generation

Generate the Merkle tree for your airdrop recipients:

```bash
bun run scripts/generate-merkle-tree.ts data/recipients.json data/merkle-tree.json
```

This creates:

- `data/merkle-tree.json` - Full tree data (for frontend proof generation)
- `data/merkle-tree.env.txt` - Environment variables (copy to `.env.local`)

The Merkle root from this output must match the root used when deploying your Sablier airdrop contract.

## Contract Compatibility

Compatible with Sablier Airdrops v2.0:

- SablierMerkleInstant
- SablierMerkleLL (Linear Lockup)
- SablierMerkleLT (Tranched Lockup)

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your customized code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy
